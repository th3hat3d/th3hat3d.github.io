### All about me
Just some nerdy kid from the States. A budding opportunist, I take any opportunity that comes my way. As a lifelong learner, I strive to learn as much as possibe about technology and anything else I'm interested in. Speaking of which, here's a list of some interests of mine, if you would like to know:
- Mathematics
- Hacking (ofc)
- Networking
- Books
- Chess
- Anything nerdy!
